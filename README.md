**Project Title: Project Management App**

**Description**
---------------

I built this to be a simple yet powerful tool for managing projects across various programming languages and technologies! As a developer, I've always found myself juggling multiple projects simultaneously. This app aims to simplify the process by providing an intuitive interface to create new projects with just the right settings.

**Features**
------------

*   **Multi-language support**: Currently supports Python, Rust, Node.js, Java, C#, C++, and Go!
*   **Dependency management**: Helps you keep track of required dependencies for each project.
*   **Project structure creation**: Automatically sets up a basic directory structure for your projects.

**Installation**
--------------

1.  Clone this repository using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2.  Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed, such as PyQt6 and subprocess.

**Usage**
---------

1.  Run the project management app using Python (e.g., `python main.py`).
2.  Create a new project by selecting the desired language and filling in the required information.
3.  Review your project setup and dependencies for accuracy.

**Contributing**
---------------

If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request! I'm always looking for ways to improve and expand its features.
